1. The parser shouldn't remove any white spaces from the data.
Double quotes should be preserved as single quotes when parsed
The CSV should be able to seperate the text only on a delimiter and not on any other keys. 
If the CSV detect bad data, it should immediately stop. 

2. This could expand the power of my testing because I would be able to have many edge 
cases that I didn't even think of. It would also make sure that my parser works on many
different data sets. With multiple random csv inputs, we are able to find bugs quicker and 
we are able to be more confident in our parser if all of our tests pass. 

3. In prior programming assignments, we were usually given a step by step instruction on how 
to do different parts of the assignment. However for this assignment we were given more freedom to 
think of our own ideas for the parser. Something that surprised me was how complicated CSV parsers really
were. I thought that they would be pretty simple but there is a lot of thought that has to go with how they 
work. Some bugs I encourtered were typescript type errors because I wasn't sure exactly how syntax worked. I 
was able to ask the LLM and consult with the typescript docs to find out the bug and fix it.
